## docker-host

A collection of platform independent scripts for managing a docker host.

 - cleanup.py - remove old images and containers
 - ntpstat.py - for win32 systems and linux similar to ntpstat. Should be part of status I suppose.
 - status.py - under development: report if this host is configured to be docker host
 - config.py - under development: configure this host to be a docker host
